# OpenCV_Tutorial

This tutorial has some essential functions of OpenCV library such as

- cvtColor, Blur, dilate, erode an img
- resize/crop img.
- geometric figures (line, rectangle, circle) and add text lines
- perspective and warp transform (extracting an object giving 4 coordinates)
- hstack and vstack img.

And as project we have:

- Face detection (cam and img) using haarcascades
- Color picker (only shows the img colored giving the HSV values)
